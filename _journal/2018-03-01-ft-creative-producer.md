## Diplomacy / change — International Criminal Court
I was an external consultant brought in to work with the internal communications team at the ICC. I worked as product manager and UX designer using during the discovery and alpha phases using design methodologies to define problems, establish user needs and develop and test possible solutions. During the beta, internal team members took over day to day running of the project while I worked on content design and governance, including style guides, as well as keeping user needs and the principles of the alpha at the forefront of the beta. I helped to manage change using various diplomacy techniques in a technologically-resistant organisation with conflicting parties (the “organs” of the court are designed not to agree). The result was a website with authority, presence, stature, decorum which served the needs of its users. I did a similar thing at the STL in 2011, but the ICC was a bigger project.

## Product invention — WorldSkills Abu Dhabi 2017 - Skill It App
I came up with an idea for a mobile game for WorldSkills Abu Dhabi, a big event that took place in October 2017 in the UAE. Students could download the iOS/Android app, start their own business, try different skill challenges at the event, collect points to help their business rise to the top and win prizes. The app encouraged exploration and competition at the event which was attended by over 80,000 students. I developed the idea in collaboration with external teams from PAN and Mettle Studios. I came up with the idea, got internal support and funding for the project, worked on testing and iterative improvements with students. I took the project from inception to various concepts to launch. I worked remotely with teams of designers/developers to create the product. It was downloaded thousands of times and average time spent in the app was over 10 minutes.

## Data / visualisation — Amnesty International
Amnesty International publish figures on death penalties and executions around the world every year. I was lead developer on a project to visualise this data on a map and a timeline using D3. I worked with the internal design and content teams along with another developer at We Are Thought Fox to create a web application. Users can play through the timeline or search for a country or both. Languages are handled via a dictionary file to avoid duplication of data and everything is hosted and edited via Github. The application is embedded using a responsive iFrame. This really tested my JavaScript skills particularly planning and developing a robust application which is easy for content editors to update in various languages (including Arabic). I’m pretty happy with it as the application works well on touch devices thanks to an autosuggest search for countries and the way the timeline changes for smaller screens.
