[Readlists](http://readlists.com/) is a new way to create an e-book from webpages, links and articles which you can send to your Kindle, iPad, or iPhone. It's a lovely experiment in compiling links and deliver them in a handy package. 

Take a look at some of the recent Readlists: it ranges from travel tips to the Philosophy and the Science of Human Nature to Suction Pile Technology. What a brilliant insight into what the collective are collecting. 

I like it a lot!
