This video - which contains spectacular aerial images of Dubai but does go on a bit - shows how Dubai has been built with aliens in mind. It's a city built for the view from space.

In contrast, London is all about the spontaneous order emerging from below. Streets and paths become bigger and wider because they are the route from one place to another. Or rather they are the route from many places to lots of other places. They are records due to journeys over hundreds of years.

It's nothing like Falcon City, but then what will a city that looks great from space be like to live in?
