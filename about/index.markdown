I've worked with clients big and small on content strategy, editorial, information architecture and 

I led the website relaunch for the [Special Tribunal for Lebanon](http://www.stl-tsl.org/), an international tribunal established by the [United Nations](http://www.un.org/).

I've created [interactive maps for Amnesty International](http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/death-penalty-2011-alarming-levels-executions-few-countries-kill-2012-03-27) using Google Fusion to give people an overview of the countries with the death penalty and allow them to explore the most recent figures.

	
  * I’ve designed and developed the award-winning multimedia project [Istabsir](http://multimedia.thenational.ae/istabsir/), observing and documenting myriad lives in the UAE.

	
  * I’ve produced compelling multimedia packages, such as [Opec at 50 map and timeline](http://www.thenational.ae/business/energy/opec-at-50), [shot and edited interesting videos](http://www.thenational.ae/events/categories/sport/pehlwani-wrestling-in-dubai) and built a lot of [interactive projects with crowdsourced elements](http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/images-and-videos-from-national-day-2010) for The National.
