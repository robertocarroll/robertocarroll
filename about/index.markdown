I'm a {{ site.job_description }} based in Abu Dhabi in the UAE until 2018. I run {{ site.description }}.

I've worked with clients big and small to build great digital products. I'm an experienced web developer who creates standards-driven CSS, HTML and JavaScript and is comfortable with mobile development, including responsive design and touch capabilities.

I'm also an experienced writer, editor and strategist who has led big web projects and has first-rate reporting, writing and sub-editing skills. Iâ€™ve written articles for The National, The Wire, Ultra Travel, The Guardian, Time Out and Profile magazine.

I work best on the borders of editorial and technology experimenting with new forms of storytelling.
