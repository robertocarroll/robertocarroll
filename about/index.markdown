Greetings! I'm Robert Carroll and I'm from Yorkshire.

I am [digital journalist and web developer](http://www.robertocarroll.com/category/projects/) for hire. I've written articles on travel, technology, parenting and photography among other things. I've planned and executed high-profile projects around the world.

Here's some of the things I've done:



	
  * I’ve written articles for The National, The Wire, The Kernel, Ultra Travel, The Guardian, Time Out and Profile magazine on subjects as diverse as [mirror neurons](http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/science/mirror-mirror-in-the-brain), [Martin Parr](http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/art/a-lens-on-luxury), [parenting](http://www.thenational.ae/lifestyle/the-bonding-ritual-known-as-the-family-snapshot), [Syrian monasteries](http://www.thenational.ae/lifestyle/travel/a-twist-of-faith-in-the-syrian-desert) and [silent disco](http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/music/a-quiet-night-out).

	
  * I led the website relaunch for the [Special Tribunal for Lebanon](http://www.stl-tsl.org/), an international tribunal established by the [United Nations](http://www.un.org/) to hold trials for the people accused of carrying out the attack of 14 February 2005 which killed 23 people, including the former prime minister of Lebanon, Rafiq Hariri, and injured many others.

	
  * I've created [interactive maps for Amnesty International](http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/death-penalty-2011-alarming-levels-executions-few-countries-kill-2012-03-27) using Google Fusion to give people an overview of the countries with the death penalty and allow them to explore the most recent figures.

	
  * I’ve designed and developed the award-winning multimedia project [Istabsir](http://multimedia.thenational.ae/istabsir/), observing and documenting myriad lives in the UAE.

	
  * I’ve produced compelling multimedia packages, such as [Opec at 50 map and timeline](http://www.thenational.ae/business/energy/opec-at-50), [shot and edited interesting videos](http://www.thenational.ae/events/categories/sport/pehlwani-wrestling-in-dubai) and built a lot of [interactive projects with crowdsourced elements](http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/images-and-videos-from-national-day-2010) for The National.
