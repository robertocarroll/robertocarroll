excerpt: Mapping death penalties and executions around the world
---

I designed and built this project for [Amnesty International](http://files.amnesty.org/deathpenalty2014/map/en/) to give people an overview of the countries with the death penalty and allow them to explore the most recent figures. I used [Google Fusion](http://www.google.com/fusiontables/Home/) to map the data.

Amnesty International had a lot of data on death penalties and executions around the world. They wanted to display this data in a way which was easy to understand. They also wanted people to be able to access the data and perhaps use it in their own work.
