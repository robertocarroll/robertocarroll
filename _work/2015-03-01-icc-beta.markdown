Following on from the work in the [ICC alpha](/work/icc-alpha/), I led the team designing and developing ICC Beta. It involved:

- Interpretting and building upon the alpha feedback
- Putting together a plan and outlining [the shape of the beta](http://robertocarroll.com/icc-beta/)
- Designing the [content templates](http://robertocarroll.com/icc-beta/style-guide/content-templates.html) and [style guide](http://robertocarroll.com/icc-beta/style-guide/) to help people in the organisation create content.
- Developing custom sections such as [maps](/work/icc-map/), [timelines](http://robertocarroll.com/icc-beta/timeline/lubanga) and other ideas such as customising content based on location.
- User testing and regular feedback.
- Lots more ... such as finding ways to [put the core texts back at the heart of the site](/journal/rome-statute-icc/)

Note: A company called [Radley Yeldar](http://ry.com) did a wider branding project that provided additional visual direction for the website. Altogether it was a great collaborative effort between a variety of internal and external teams which took over a year. It was a privilege to have been part of.
