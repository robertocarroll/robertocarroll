excerpt: Creating new blogs for Middle East art fair
---

I worked with [Art Dubai](http://www.artdubai.ae/) developing [their blog](http://www.artdubai.ae/blog/) and sites for [Art Week ](http://artweek.ae/) (now offline) and [Design Days Dubai ](http://www.designdaysdubai.ae/blogs/).

I helped to integrate Google Maps to display each gallery and each region, as well as develop the information architecture and ways to filter by tags within categories.
