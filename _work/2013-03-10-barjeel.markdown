excerpt: Creating a new identity and website for art foundation
---

[Barjeel Art Foundation](http://www.barjeelartfoundation.org) was the first big project for [We Are Thought Fox](http://wearethoughtfox.com).

We created a new identity for the foundation in digital and print. Clint has [written about this process on Barjeel's website](http://www.barjeelartfoundation.org/news/barjeel-rebranded).

I was responsible for creating the information architecture, which highlighted the relationships between artists, countries and exhibitions and encouraged people to explore the collection.

I built the WordPress theme using standards-driven CSS, HTML and JavaScript and responsive design to create a great experience on any device.
