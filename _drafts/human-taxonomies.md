What are human taxonomies???

Cicardian rhythms ....

Seasons

Time

Holidays

Placing things in filters makes them seem inhuman

Surprise / serendipity

What is the central experience?

Can it listen????

Outward perspective - life beyond the screens

Leave room for the imagination !!!!!

Engage the senses!!!

Stomp stomp

connect to personal epochs / seasons
