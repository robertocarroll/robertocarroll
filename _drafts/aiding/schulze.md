Product invention workshops
microbriefs - 

We came up with 30 or so ideas which got narrowed down to 5 ‘microbriefs’ for possible future prototyping. Microbriefs are our way of expressing products that test an idea by making it real, and the brief can be taken forward by the client internally, with the help of an agency, or with BERG.

making - maps, time, comics

Have to be making in order to think

“When you cut into the present, the future leaks out” - [William Boroughs](http://dangerousminds.net/comments/a_word_in_your_era_william_burroughs_explains_brion_gysins_cut_up_method)

Gartner Hype cycle - a "real joke" - tech that people are talking about in the world mapped onto a chart

1. Technology trigger - just born 
1. Peak of inflated expectations - obsessed
1. Trough of disillusionment - slow drift - regarded as dull 
1. Slope of enlightment
1. Plateau of productivity / profitability 

Our favourite place to play: trough of disillusionment - cheap, dull, curious about the dull stuff. 

Materials - grain / affordances / opportunities - extend the metaphor to include software, time, radio - 

"All products are hybrids of radiation and matter. The radio space is actual and physical. We're all in the wash of wi-fi, bluetooth and radio."

Invisibility allows/permits mythology (which can be wrong) - visualise and explain

Cameras are a way of lying about time. Long exposure 

Connected products - 

Focused at the moment on using the internet like a really long piece of wire - Fine but not great. Moving UI from object to phone. Not really solving a big problem.  

Products with rich behaviours which want to go further than 

"Lying about the future makes history" - Umberto Eco 

"The best way to predict the future is to invent it" - Alan Kay

Media can leak into your life in an ignorable way but still be interesting.

News, social media, Foursquare checkins - all mixed together. 

How can technology sit in our lives subtly and make an impact.

"the smell of the age" - products / media / graphics - posters and chairs

Our era was going to be shaped by software, technology - those are the defining artifacts of our times 

We can make better stuff by putting heart in it. 

Not just about technology, utility and effeciency

Combination of humanity / technology as a way of imbuing soul and heart in work produced

**Performative objects **- culture, fun - not functionally better - 

Software and the web - the greatest stuff - potential for magic, fun, poetry, cultural invention 

Web - first tool you could get your hands on - 

Short, low resolution, punctual, pertinent, targeted 

Physics is awesome - we're stuck to the planet and happening right now. 

The geography of software - putting social software in things - embedding software in objects

mythology - utility of often not really as valuable as it claims to be 

culture is a broader canvas than utility and solving problems - make lovely stuff
