Only there for the morning. 

Morag Myerscough Morag
Do what you want to do. Do things that feel right. FUN

Re-evAluate how things are done when you do them

Where do you find inspiration?

Live in a place full of energy

Have obsessions. Follow them.

Thinking - how does something work? Deep careful thought.

Morag - shes done some cool stuff but is a tad self obsessed.

An indifferent reaction is the worst.

Dont like theme (as a word) - rather what springs from the content.

How do you make a feeling?

Supergroup - group of people you've worked with    ... Pitch for projects beyond yourself

Jack Schulze

We talk about the future a lot at berg - loaded with promise and excitement

But never represented well - dull minority report

Lying about the future makes history - eco

When you cut into the present, the future leaks out - burroughs

The present is exciting - just lots of dull people around saying otherwise.

Electricity
Connection - wire / radio / wifi
Existing human behaviour

Interaction design:
Verplank - 
Bill modridge

Object
Do
Responds
How does it make you feel?
Map of object in head


Smartphones broke that - you cannot have a map of everything your phone does - it doesnt happen in your phone - giant , ugly infrastruture in the world beyond 

Huge infrastructure is leaking out into personal space - eg check in for flight via text message

Theres no more u in ui - the roomba

Behaviour
Motive
Agency

Software and things as companions - companion centred design.

Helicopters / kinect  - playing squash - video

Besaap - be as smart as a puppy

Ubicomp. Media. Immaterials.

Media - in a shitty state. Great / lots of opportunity

Phone - fastest growing habit in history of humanity.

Phones make more money in quarter than hollywood in a year

Iphone icons - proxies for so much - infrastructure / services / publications - but all get the same space


Television - huge infrastructure just in case you want to watch cash in the actic

Newspaper - huge infrastructure just in case you want to read ... 

Imagine guardian editor on dragons den. 400 people in huge office, print, distribute to shops around the country, sell for a pound just in case you want to read the news that morning - it's a mad process that would not get off the ground today.


Bridget riley - the kiss

Experience - apple

Data  - google

Infrastructure doesnt matter - youre either experience or data

Google, apple, facebook - war over phones

Materials - grain / use 

Immaterials - data sets, radio waves

Stamen:
Show you everything - let you filter and do what you want with it

Scooscope - scraping school data

Written by computers - 


Paradio - see faces in objects - hello little  fella

Right now we're bathed in radio 

Radio is material - iphones has about seven radios

Making invisible visible 

Technology is weird - create language and stories to talk about tech


Nearfield - light painting

Grant morrison - the filth. - leaves the comic


Light painting - a way of playing with time. - camera picks up light on long exposure which is actually there

Normative speculation
Guesswork

Shifting perspectives - wainwrights maps, hockney on perspective dismissing canaletto and entire italian renaissance

Control like a limb
An extension of self
Tool 

Satellite views - omnipotence to it
Macroscope - john thackara

How to deal with scale / numbers - big preoccupation

If you have a choice never have a job - glaser

Its never been easier to know what people think

Get stuff out into the world - do through making

Think through making

Line up companies with wealth. - point it at what you want to do
