My notes 


Modularity needs shared language - developed with team - naming of things is important - print out to see duplicates. This language needs to be used to evolve.

Shared language - naming things is hard

Library or core objects - 
Standardise, naming - function not aesthetic
Atomic design - brad frost
Distinct. How they fit together. Like building a kit - eg little bits

If every bit fits to every other bit, where is composition, balance, story

Blocks have hierarchy - you can only use banner once

Chemistry between elements - what goes wirh what

See futurelearn discussion of this. 

Unix philosophy - every component does one job. Do it really well.

Gold standard - web components

Image audits 
Where to put breakpoints - art direction, performance budget

Use src set and sizes to give the browser options

Type - 

Often things are Prescriptions not systems - systems need to be active

Think of css as regular expressions for markup

See prime nunbers and flexbox for creating mosaics - nth 

Quantitive query - playing with flexbox and quantity queries

Danielguillan sass mixin - 

@Heydonworks

Element queries

Let ux drive design not technology - think about the experience you want to create. Desigb fiction


Constraints breed creativity - assumptions can tease out interesting stuff

Use standard web tecnologies

Information seemed precious. Now firehose - we are all libraries - 

Hard and boring is kryptonite


Synthesis e metacognition

Virtuoso generelist - get somerhing done even if you domt know how to do ir yet

So many oprions so many xhoices - need constraints 

Impose constraints - bring focus - antidote to overchoice

Start from centre move outwards

Receive wisdom
Practice
Share

@Lyzadanger

The web is about access 

Good experiences for all - we all have special needs

Experience crafted as a continuum which is appropriate

Postels law 

We cant control the world only our reaction to it

Embrace diversity

Rawls - experiment

Media pointer control
Media queries 4 
Pointer eventd

Couch mode - cas font sizing

Steph hay - interface is conversation with users

Desiging for gesture and voice 

Experience as a continuum starting with text
