INTRO
1. -
2. “Gutenberg mind” - Marshall McLuhan’s memorable phrase
Networked culture creates different social, psychological and cultural behaviours
3. dialogic - not declarations - one-way broadcasting
4. -
5. we picked up on stuff which is already happening and tried to create a framework which would encourage that behaviour and help people present it back to the world. The idea of “open source” kept cropping up as a model for collaboration and co-creating. Perhaps an even better one is “view source”. Being able to view source on a HTML page is a vital part of seeing how a webpage is constructed, copy and pasting it and using it yourself.
experimentation, personal expression, tribes and remixing.
6. Not augmentation - not saying adding other forms of media will improve - like ebooks and multimedia.
Not creating more and more distractions - augmentations
Path to shallower engagement, more distance between the viewer and the object.
7. Not about sound effects, film clips, or point-and-click “interaction”. Don’t get in the way of deep engagement with artwork.
8. Bringing the “grain” of the web  - its affordances and textures -  to Hepworth’s sculptures. What would the ability to “view source” look like for sculpture? What behaviours would it encourage? Would they be worthwhile?
We’ve been exploring these strands together, each person taking the lead on a particular exploration.

RECONTEXTUALISED
2. As long as works of art are exhibited in a gallery, the essence of the experience of viewing art remains bound by a particular set of rules.
3. From forgeries to postcards, plaster casts to T-Shirts prints, methods of reproduction have existed alongside the works of art themselves. New methods are emerging and improving all the time. Yet is it possible to reproduce a work of art and present it in a context which does not strip artworks, as Benjamin suggests, of their ‘aura’? What is lost and what is gained?
4. The technology for capturing objects and reproducing them is continually improving and becoming cheaper and more widely available. People are already doing this and have been for many years. Institutions need to work out how to harness this behaviour rather than ignore it.
5. What’s a good size for an object someone to handle and still feel substantial and worthwhile? What about definition and accuracy?
6. A viewer can place the object in a zone of projected light. The camera recognises the object (computer vision) and projects information around it. Give objects with new properties. Form and history.
7. - What information is useful and appropriate in this context?
- Can we use or imbue these reactions in the objects and their augmentations without interfering or overwhelming the artwork?
8. - Can we highlight connections between objects? eg Different information displayed depending on the preceding object.
- Someone can journey through the collection, get lost in the collection and see how artworks link together by different criteria (metadata)
- How to tell a story in this medium?
9. We can collect reactions in various ways: computer vision, observe, transcribe, take photos and video, record audio, interview people, enable them to comment (paper, SMS, Twitter). Is it useful? Will people find it odd?
10. All the information is online as well. Bridges the physical and the digital. Creates many possibilities.
