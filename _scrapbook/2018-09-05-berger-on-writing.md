“Whatever one is writing, one is trying to tell the story of being here at this moment in time. Art is the provocation for talking about enigma and the search for sense in human life. One can do that by telling a story or writing about a fresco by Giotto or studying how a snail climbs up a wall.”

\- John Berger
