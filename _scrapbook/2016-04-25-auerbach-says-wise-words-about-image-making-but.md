<blockquote>Auerbach says wise words about image-making, but they apply equally to storytelling: “Until the subject becomes an idea, it doesn’t exist for the painter… the most tremendously tangible expression of an object…unless it has feeling… is inert and academic and studio-bound… When you’re painting, you’re making a picture… the feelings will be there if you’ve got them… really imagining and inhabiting it…”</blockquote>&#8212;From Elise V&rsquo;s Facebook page
