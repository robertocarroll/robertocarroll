Curtis dismisses the suggestion that the internet is now a source of scrutiny and agent for transparency.

> I am hugely sceptical about this idea that interactivity will create a new kind of democracy and spread of power. If you look at the years since the rise of the internet, power has become more consolidated, more elitist, less open to examination, so the interactive utopians have failed to deliver the power to the people they promised.
