<blockquote>Media technologies in fact are not at odds with our inner selves but are in fact a reflection of it, it comes from that. These technologies extended our senses out into the world, they cross space and time, they function as out of the body experiences, they represent a set of phenomena that until relatively recently was classified as psychic manifestations or shamanistic acts.</blockquote>
