<blockquote>In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: “If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.</blockquote>&#8212;Chesterton&rsquo;s fence.

Later, you look at them and wonder what you don’t know&rdquo; <a href="https://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/805612201138483200">https://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/805612201138483200</a>
