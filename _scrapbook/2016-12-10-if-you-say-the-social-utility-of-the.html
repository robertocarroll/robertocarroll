<blockquote>If you say &ldquo;The social utility of the indeterminate sentence is recognized by all criminologists as a part of our sociological evolution towards a more humane and scientific view of punishment,&rdquo; you can go on talking like that for hours with hardly a movement of the gray matter inside your skull.
