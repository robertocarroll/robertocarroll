<blockquote>We’re culturally taught now that there’s this thing called happiness that’s achievable,” he sighs. Where we’re just happy because we’ve done this and that, we’ve gotten there, we’ve bought this house and we’ve got these kids and we’re just happy now. That’s a relatively new idea. Because happiness doesn’t exist. A happy morning exists and then maybe a depressing lunch and a bad afternoon and maybe a nice evening. We’re sold this concept and I realise that I’m one of the people that’s helping do this because I’m responsible also for our contemporary consumer culture.</blockquote>&#8212;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/23/tom-ford-suit-set-film-nocturnal-animals-director">Tom Ford</a>
