<blockquote>Lots of writing leans on film editing techniques in the wrong way. They support a laziness that would not be tolerated in cinema. They cut between things in an implausible way. That’s OK in cinema because you’re showing not telling. Many writers won’t allow themselves the courage of convictions to just show. They keep having to lead the reader by her hand. They won’t just put it on the page and trust the reader to decipher what’s going on.</blockquote>&#8212;Will Self - Final TX podcast
