<blockquote>Now the trumpet summons us again&ndash;not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need&ndash;not as a call to battle, though embattled we are&ndash; but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out, &lsquo;rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation&rsquo;&ndash;a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease and war itself</blockquote>&#8212;JFK speech
