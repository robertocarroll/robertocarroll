<blockquote>Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn&rsquo;t really do it. They just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while; that&rsquo;s because they were able to connect experiences they&rsquo;ve had and synthesize new things. And the reason they were able to do that was that they&rsquo;ve had more experiences or they have thought more about their experiences than other people. Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s too rare a commodity. A lot of people in our industry haven&rsquo;t had very diverse experiences.</blockquote>&#8212;<a href="http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/4.02/jobs_pr.html">http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/4.02/jobs_pr.html</a><br/>
