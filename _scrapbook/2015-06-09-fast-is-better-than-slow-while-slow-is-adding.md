<blockquote>Fast is better than slow. While slow is adding unnecessary embellishments, fast is out in the world. And that means fast can learn from experience while slow can only theorize. Those who ship quickly can improve quickly. So fast doesn&rsquo;t just win the race. It gets a head start for the next one.</blockquote>
