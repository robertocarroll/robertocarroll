<blockquote>
  <p>Bowie: We’re on the cusp of something exhilarating and terrifying.</p>

  <p>Paxman: (The internet) is just a tool though isn’t it?</p>

  <p>Bowie: No, it’s not, it’s an alien life form. […] The actual context and state of content is going to be so different to anything we can envisage at the moment. Where the interplay between user and provider will be so in simpatico it’s going to crush our ideas of what mediums are all about.</p>
