<blockquote>The course and consequences of the present world economic crisis are unpredictable. In a few months, the vast balloon of expectations built on false assumptions about the world’s resources was pricked. On balance, despite the difficulties and hardship that must result, we can be thankful that the crisis has exploded prematurely, for political reasons, while the world still commands enough time and resources to effect the far-reaching changes that are required to bring our demands on nature into harmony with nature’s ability to satisfy them. One consequence must be that the practice of architecture will have to undergo a transformation, requiring a return to first principles and the release of the latent skills and energies that are now being misused or frustrated.</blockquote>&#8212;(Malcolm MacEwan, Crisis in Architecture, 1974)&ldquo; (from &quot;Dark matter and trojan horses. A strategic design vocabulary.&rdquo; by Dan Hill)
