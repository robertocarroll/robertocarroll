<blockquote>I was under no illusion that I was going to be some big movie star. My dad said, &lsquo;If you got hit by a bus tomorrow, were you living your life truthfully, or were you waiting to get rich?&rsquo; If I died and my soul started leaving my body, would I be looking down going, 'You idiot. You could have gone to Prague, you could have been on Broadway&rsquo;? Those are the things I wanted to do.</blockquote>&#8212;Julianna Margulies
