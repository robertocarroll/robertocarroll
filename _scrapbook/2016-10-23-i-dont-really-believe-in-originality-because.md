<blockquote>I don’t really believe in originality, because there are a limited number of stories, but there’s an unlimited number of ways to tell them… I believe it is only theft if you take somebody’s idea before they’ve realized it and say it was your own, and then you’re just a full-on asshole… [But] if you take something that moved you and you make another version, I think that’s just beautiful. I think that’s just the nature of creating things.</blockquote>&#8212;<a href="http://nofilmschool.com/2016/10/five-must-see-films-according-jim-jarmusch">Jim Jarmusch</a> (via <a href="http://tumblr.austinkleon.com/" class="tumblr_blog">austinkleon</a>)
