<blockquote>Theatre was a very important means of communication. Governments don&rsquo;t always cover what you want or need. You can&rsquo;t express yourself necessarily in newspapers. But there is something about theatre that is inventive, that is creative, that is still alive, which [&hellip;] means you can say what you have to say.</blockquote>&#8212;Blanche Marvin on Desert Island Discs (Fri 16 Nov 2012) <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/9933bcba#b01ntlrs">http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/9933bcba#b01ntlrs</a><br/>
