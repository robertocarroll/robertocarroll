<p>We have built upon technologies that are quite old now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s reclaim the web from technologists who tell us that the future they&rsquo;ve imagined is inevitable, and that our role in it is as consumers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The web we have right now is beautiful. It shatters the tyranny of distance. It opens the libraries of the world to you. It gives you a way to bear witness to people half a world away, in your own words. It is full of cats. We built it by accident, yet already we&rsquo;re taking it for granted. We should fight to keep it!&rdquo;</p>
