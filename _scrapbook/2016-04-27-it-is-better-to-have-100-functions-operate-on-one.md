<blockquote>“It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data struc- ture,” wrote computer scientist Alan J. Perlis, thirty years ago, “than ten functions on ten data structures.” He meant: focus on your data, then code around it. Applications are there to serve the data, not the other way around.</blockquote>&#8212;Paul Ford in Foreword of &lsquo;Content Strategy for Mobile&rsquo;
