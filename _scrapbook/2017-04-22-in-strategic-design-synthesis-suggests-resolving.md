<blockquote>In strategic design, synthesis suggests resolving into a course of action, whereas analysis suggests a presentation of data. Analysis tells you how things are, at least in theory, whereas synthesis suggests how things could be.</blockquote>&#8212;from &ldquo;Dark matter and trojan horses. A strategic design vocabulary.&rdquo; by Dan Hill)
