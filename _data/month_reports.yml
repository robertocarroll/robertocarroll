  summary: 'A varied month. Not working particularly hard, but lots of things going on. I worked at The Sun for a few days. Caught up with lovely people in London. Stayed on an island in Twickenham and a sofa in Shoreditch. The Hepworth Challenge rumbled on as did the Barjeel app. Henry Moore at the Sculpture park was OK, but not amazing. The Sing-a-long Sound of Music was remarkable: nuns clutching pints, many interjections and acting out; best bit of theatre in years.'  
  prev_goal: 'HIT. Wrote morning pages on 20 days this month.'
  new_goal: 'Get going on the book. Not just research and structure, but writing at least 500 words on more than 12 days.'
