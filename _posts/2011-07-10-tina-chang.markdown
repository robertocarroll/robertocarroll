[Tina Chang](http://www.tinachang.ca) is a fashion photographer currently living and working in the United Arab Emirates. I developed her new website using [Slideshow Pro](http://www.slideshowpro.net).

## The challenge


Tina needed a new website with two main requirements: it must be easy to update and it must work on Apple devices.

## The solution


I customised [Slideshow Pro](http://www.slideshowpro.net)Â including doing some work with the API to integrate [Galleria](http://galleria.io/) Fullscreen slideshow. Tina loves her new website because she can update it easily. She's had a lot of good responses from fashion industry types as well.

## My role in the project


I sketched out the initial wireframes and planned the layout of the website. Then I worked with Anna Coe, a designer based in Berlin, to develop the look and feel. I coded the HTML/CSS and integrated Slideshow Pro with Galleria using the SSP API.
