excerpt: Prototyping a new approach to digital based on user needs
---

Leading a digital project to create a new website for the International Criminal Court. 

I conducted research and analysis - interviews, surveys, search logs and analytics - to determine the shape of the alpha and instill a ruthless adherence to serving user needs. 

I helped put together a team and we worked remotely following an agile approach to build a prototype of the most important parts of the site. The site took four months to design and build and was tested on a variety of users around the world. ICC Beta began later in the year.
