excerpt: Telling stories from the Deep Sea Slum in Nairobi, Kenya
---

I made [this interactive panorama](http://amnesty.org/en/slums-widget) for Amnesty International.

It tells the story of the people living in the Deep Sea Slum in Nairobi, Kenya. I built the interactive image in HTML5 and Flash so it will work on phones and tablets as well as computers.
