excerpt: Exploring the IPPF’s work around the world
---

[We Are Thought Fox](http://wearethoughtfox.com) designed and developed an interactive map for [The International Planned Parenthood Federation](http://www.ippf.org/) to show the policy effects of the IPPF’s work around the world this year.

We used [Mapbox](http://mapbox.com) and hosted it on Github. Updates are done through [Geojson.io](http://geojson.io/). This approach means we can use static files but also have editing and version control.

[You can see the map here](http://ippf.github.io/ippf/)
