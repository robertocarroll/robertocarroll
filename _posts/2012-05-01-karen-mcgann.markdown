I built a responsive portfolio website for the director [Karen McGann](http://www.karenmcgann.com/)


She needed a way to present clips of her work. I created this website using Wordpress with Vimeo integration to make it easy for her to upload her clips. Using Vimeo in this way and integrating it into the workflow also gives her work an audience on another channel without extra effort.

I've helped organisations - big and small - create great websites. [Do get in touch](mailto:robertocarroll@gmail.com) if you would like to work with me.
