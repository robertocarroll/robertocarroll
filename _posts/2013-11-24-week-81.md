I've been trying - and failing - to do weeknotes for while now. This post originally started off as Week 78 and grew higher week by week as I failed to write something each weekend.    

24 November is the end of Week 81 from start of We Are Thought Fox on 30 April 2012. It's been going for well over a year. It's going alright. 

This week was all about the alpha build of _Abaris_, a big digital project I have been working on since September. The design and content work of the first sprint is starting to take shape on-screen and there's plenty of groundwork laid for the next couple of sprints. All in all, it's starting to shape up nicely. 

I also wrapped up a couple of design changes to a map project which will be launching soon and I had a promising email about the glimmer of a new digital project in the Middle East.
