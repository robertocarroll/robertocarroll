I designed and built this project for [Amnesty International](http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/death-penalty-2011-alarming-levels-executions-few-countries-kill-2012-03-27) to give people an overview of the countries with the death penalty and allow them to explore the most recent figures. I used [Google Fusion](http://www.google.com/fusiontables/Home/) to map the data.


Amnesty International had a lot of data on death penalties and executions around the world. They wanted to display this data in a way which was easy to understand. They also wanted people to be able to access the data and perhaps use it in their own work.

I created a custom map using polygon shapes. I defined the colours for different ranges to create this visualisation.

When you click on the country it displays a popup box with more information.

This project was quite complex because it needed five maps (2007 to 2011) as well as a video. Google Maps doesn't like being placed in a display:none; div so it took some work to centre the maps. (I'll try to write up how I did this at some point.)

The other issue was languages: French, Spanish and Arabic. Google Fusion worked well at importing the translated spreadsheets. The result is pretty good, I think, given the time we had.


I've helped organisations - big and small - create great websites. [Do get in touch](mailto:robertocarroll@gmail.com) if you would like to work with me.
