[The National](http://www.thenational.ae) is a newspaper in the United Arab Emirates which was launched by ex-Telegraph editor Martin Newland in 2008. I worked on the website from 2008 to 2010. I worked on the project to relaunch the website. It was plagued by technological problems due to a poor technology decisions and an appalling technology company. Despite these factors, the website launched and the project started to become a success.

## The challenge


To create the best online source of news, business, sport and culture in the Middle East. A major issue was how to make the most of the vast amount of content produced every day by The National’s extensive network of journalists, correspondents and photographers to create a vibrant, popular and authorative news website. Implementation of a new content management system was also part of the requirements.

## The solution


Restructure the website’s information architecture, refocus on key target audiences and increase accessibility and ease of use. Fewer channels to simplify navigation. Topics to create “living urls” for a wide range of subjects. Managed comments, blogs and debates to increase audience interaction in a politically sensitive region. A user-centred design process with extensive, localised testing is important in this diverse and idiosyncratic country.

## My role in the project


I conducted workshops with key stakeholders, compiled features and functionality requirements, analysed competitors, developed information architecture and conducted user interviews and testing. I became one of the primary liaisons with [Fortune Cookie](http://www.fortunecookie.co.uk/), a web-design company hired to design the front-end. Many of my findings and ideas became part of the final design.
