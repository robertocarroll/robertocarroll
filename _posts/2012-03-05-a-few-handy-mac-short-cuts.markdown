I was surprised when I moved from a PC to a Mac a few years ago how adrift the change of operating system left me. All the keyboard shortcuts and little tricks gathered over years melted away to leave me feeling like a computer novice. Here's some of the most useful Mac shortcuts I've learnt over the last few years, posted as much as a reference for myself as anything else.


1. **FINDER - **Space bar in Finder - Previews a file. Works with text, images and video.

2. **FINDER - **Hold down command and double click on a folder to open it in a new Finder window.

3. **CHROME - **Shift + Cmd + t opens the last tab closed.

4. **TEXT EDITOR  - **Shift + Cmd + v pastes text without formatting.

5. **MAC **- Cmd + Tab brings up the app switcher and allows you to move from one program to another using keys.

6. **TEXT EDITOR  - **A few things I can never remember:



	
  * Shift + Alt + 2 gives me a € sign.

	
  * Alt + 3 gives me a £ sign.

	
  * Shift + 3 gives me a # sign.

	
  * Cmd + Arrow goes to beginning or end of a line.


7. **MAC - **Cmd + Alt + Esc brings up the Force Quit panel.

8. **FINDER **-Press enter with a file selected to rename it.
