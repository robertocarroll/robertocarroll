The Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (Protocol) allows individuals and groups to seek justice from the UN if their rights are violated and their government does not provide justice.

I made [this interactive map](http://www.amnesty.org/en/campaigns/making-rights-law/making-rights-law) for Amnesty International using Google Fusion. 

People can see the status of countries and explore case studies.
