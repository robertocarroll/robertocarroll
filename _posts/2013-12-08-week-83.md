To The Hague this week for a couple of days work on _Abaris_, the big digital project that is taking up most of my time. Lots of useful conversations about the alpha version of this project with subjects ranging from videos to design to content. 

When I came back, I got stuck in to editing various videos and sections of text for the explanatory section, which is starting to take shape nicely.
