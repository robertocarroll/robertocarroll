Hotels are protean structures. Demolished and rebuilt to satisfy the economic demands of their owners; revamped to accommodate the needs and whims of their guests: few hotels survive for many years unscathed. No doubt most are more pleasant places as a result, but blandness lurks behind this process. Like the digitally altered images that fill glossy magazines, we have little idea of what has been lost in this quest.

Here's the list:



	
  1. Le Corbusier hotel, Marseille, France

	
  2. Bauhaus Dessau Foundation, Dessau, Germany

	
  3. Africa Pension, Asmara, Eritrea

	
  4. Historic Park Inn, Mason City, Iowa, US

	
  5. Laine Hotel, Riga, Latvia

	
  6. New Yorker Hotel, Miami Beach, US

	
  7. Hotel Therme, Vals, Switzerland

	
  8. Brasilia Palace Hotel, Brasilia, Brazil

	
  9. La Concha, San Juan, Puerto Rico

	
  10. Habana Riviera, Havana, Cuba
