Trains hark back to a different era, when travel was unhurried and journeys took days rather than hours. The recent resurgence in travelling by train has much to do with the way it dwells on the things flights hurry over. Trains counter the disorientation of air travel. They join the dots between departures and arrivals, putting the focus back on the journey as much as the destination. These remarkable train routes, which pass through some of the most spectacular landscapes in the world, revel in luxuries - not only of things like food and accommodation but time as well. They make you savour each kilometre travelled and remember the experience. If that all sounds a tad indulgent, it's worth pointing out that train travel is much less polluting than a similar trip by air.
