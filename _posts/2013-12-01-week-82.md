A week working on various parts of _Abaris_, the big digital project that is taking up most of my time. 

I made the first version of an explanatory section, installed lots of bits and pieces on my computer to create an example of an interactive choropleth map and worked on various planning parts of the project. 

On Wednesday I caught up with [Clint](http://www.clintmclean.com), who's doing lots of photography work at the moment.
