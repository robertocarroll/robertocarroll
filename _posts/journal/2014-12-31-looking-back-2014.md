what happened in 2014?

## Here's a few things to focus on in the coming year. 

* Get work into the world - improve the ratio of ideas to things made
* Travel to at least three new countries
* Reading the Shakespeare's plays in chronological order
* Focus - Hone existing skills rather than learn new ones
* Publish at least five articles and a short story
* More writing - actual get those ideas going that I've been mulling over for so long
