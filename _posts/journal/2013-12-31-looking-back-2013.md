what happened in 2013? I'll get around to writing this at some point.

## Here's a few things to focus on in the coming year. 

* Writing more articles and essays 
* Doing Code Club
* Doing a text analysis project in Python 
* Exploring Denmark, Sweden and Norway in the campervan 
* Learning JavaScript (properly)
* Read a book instead (less screens)
* More music - listening and playing
* Doing more fun stuff with Thing 1 and Thing 2
