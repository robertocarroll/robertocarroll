A few month ago, I installed a Wordpress plugin called [Limit Login Attempts](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/limit-login-attempts/). It limits the number of login attempts on your Wordpress admin. I wasn't convinced it was necessary. After all, this website is a small and humble part of the interweb. I recently looked at the statistics and was surprised that there's been lots of attempts blocked.

So if you used Wordpress, I encourage you to install this plugin and add a little bit more security to your installation.

Do you have any tips on improving Wordpress security? I'd [love to hear from you on Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/robertocarroll).
