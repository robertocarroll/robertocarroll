We’re often told the world’s getting smaller every day with hardly anywhere left unexplored. Yet people tend to visit the same places year after year and travel publications write about the same places repeatedly.

I've been thinking about new ways to explore the world and one idea I came up with was Zombie Traveller, a way to make the world feel a bigger place again by suggesting the best, less-popular destinations. By harvesting information every week, Zombie Traveller will allow you to feel how suitable a destination is in much the same way you feel the weather. The data would power a suggestion engine, taking into account destination, current location and other preferences to suggest different, similar places to visit.

I've entered this idea in the Knight News Challenge. Here's the full entry for [Zombie Traveller](http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/19180012156/zombie-traveller). 

I've also been collected ideas around new approaches to travel on this [Tumblr](http://ontheroadtonowhere.tumblr.com).
