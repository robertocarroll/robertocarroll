A few day's research work for a client of [Evolutia Design](http://www.evolutia.co.uk/) called [Chersoft](http://www.chersoft.co.uk/). 

Chersoft are a software development and consultancy company specialising in marine data management. I created some ad-hoc personas to be used during the design and development of their new website. 

It was interesting to get a chance to use Tamara Adlin's idea of ad-hoc personas. These personas are intended to bring focus to design decisions and are based around business and user goals rather than data.

We worked with the stakeholders to prioritise these personas to help focus on the most important users, features and goals and then use them to help shape development.
