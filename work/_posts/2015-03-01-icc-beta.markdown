excerpt: Relaunching the website for an international organisation
---

I began with user research to identify the most important areas of the TAQA website to improve. Rather than a complete redesign we focused on improving regional content, the careers section and improving the look and feel of the entire site. I worked on the IA, layouts and content for these new sections helping stakeholders in Canada, the UK, Iraq, the UAE and the Netherlands to get the most out of the new design while maintaining a consistent style and tone.

I also built a new regional map, which quickly and simply allows users to explore TAQA's main regions and see the types of operations.

With the new designs and content in place, I developed appropriate metrics to help monitor and improve the website in the future.
