excerpt: Social media storytelling about what it's really like looking for a job
---

[MSN Jobseekers](http://jobseekers.news.uk.msn.com) was a project about looking for a job. Over the course of this nine-week project, we followed the lives of six jobseekers as they looked for work.

Working as part of [Devolve Communications](http://www.devolvecommunications.co.uk), I was the editor on the project – planning, commissioning, editing and writing articles on a range of issues from [finding out about how jobseekers spend their days](http://extras.uk.msn.com/jobseekers/msn-jobseekers-a-day-in-the-life-of-a-jobseeker) to charting [the rise of zero hours contracts](http://extras.uk.msn.com/jobseekers/zero-hours-contracts-on-the-rise).
